### Storrei app
Open source node.js project utilizing Grapes JS to build websites

#### Demo the project locally

This project uses Firebase for certain functionality, which you will need to set up for your project to work even to run it locally. You can include your Firebase API key in a .env file to set it up to work the same way that I did for this project. Without Firebase authentication and database connection, you can still use Grapes JS but you cannot save your work.
